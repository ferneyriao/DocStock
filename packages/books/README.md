### Chess Opening Book

This is a Python project which might not work out of the box on your machine. First install
the chess modules: https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/

I had some issues with the following command

    $> pip3 install python-chess

But got it working with

    $> python3 -m pip install python-chess --user

To see if everything is working run the following

    $> ts-node ./test.ts
    e2e4 1 486544384
    d2d4 1 5120
    c2c4 1 3825144832
